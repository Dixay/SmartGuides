SmartGuides.lua is a Guide Script made for Aseprite
that visually adds customizable crosshairs and shapes (rectangles or squares) to your canvas, with enhanced flexibility and usability.

What It Does:
Adds horizontal and vertical guides that split the canvas evenly.
Creates a customizable shape (rectangle or square) based on a percentage of the canvas size.
Automatically adjusts line thickness based on canvas size.
Lets you choose colors, transparency, and patterns for both the crosshair and the shape.
Allows you to place the shape in a new layer or combine it with the crosshair layer.
Saves your settings for future use.
Installation:
Download the .lua file.
In Aseprite, go to File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder.
Paste or drop the script into the Scripts folder.
In Aseprite, press F5 or go to File > Scripts > Rescan Scripts Folder.
Use:

In the dialog:
Pick colors and adjust transparency for both the crosshair and the shape.
Select line styles and base thickness.
Set the size of the shape as a percentage of the canvas.
Toggle whether the shape should be placed in a new layer.
Enable or disable auto-hide for the guides.
Click Create – the guides and shape will appear on new layers with unique names!
